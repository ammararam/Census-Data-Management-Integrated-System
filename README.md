# Census-Data-Management-Integrated-System
Many management decisions should be made using census data in many organizations. However, data in many formats and sometime paper-based format can make such a huge barrier for efficient management or even maintenance. This application was developed by using ESRI spatial components including ArcGIS Engine and ArcObjects and C#.NET programming. Producing custom statistical indicators and reports are provided by integrating all census data of the provinces and cities in IRAN from 1990 to 2015 form different formats.  A huge SDEGeodatabase used by SQL server as DBMS was design and developed for data management part of the system. The high proficiency by reducing human errors and spending time for searching was achieved by this application in Naghsh Click international Company in 2013. 

This repository includes only a part of the whole project code.
